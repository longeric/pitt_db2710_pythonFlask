Within these spaces the player takes control of a robot, instructed by a god-like figure to complete the puzzles available to them. Common gameplay elements include \"Jammers\", devices which can be used to disable enemies or open doorways, and \"Connectors\", devices which can be used to create rudimentary circuits. Using these and other tools, players must collect the \"Sigils\" hidden in each stage. When all of a certain class of Sigil are collected, the player must connect them together in a Tetris-like grid puzzle to unlock new areas or items. Throughout levels, players can also find messages left across the walls by what seem to be older participants in the puzzles. They can also periodically access a computer system which contains cryptic texts, messages from the developers of a computer program, and a simple AI. The AI often challenges the philosophical beliefs of the player, using rationalist and Socratic lines of thought.", "release_date": "2014-12-11T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "Rocket League", "platform": "PlayStation 4", "genre": "association football video game", "image": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Rocket%20League%20logo.svg", "bomb": "3030-34407", "desc": "Rocket League is a multiplayer-focused vehicular \"sports-action\" game developed and published by Psyonix Studios.

The most notable feature of the game is the new \"Close Range Assault System\", although it also adds destructible environments and dramatic camera angles of planes blowing up.", "release_date": "2011-10-11T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "Outlast", "platform": "PlayStation 4", "genre": "survival horror", "image": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Outlast.jpg", "bomb": "3030-40089", "desc": "Outlast is a survival-horror game that is focused on evading enemies rather than defeating them.
